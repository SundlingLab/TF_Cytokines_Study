## Plasma protein profiling reveals diverse patterns in patients with fever after traveling to tropical areas


In this study, we measured 49 host-response proteins in the plasma of 124 patients with fever after travel to tropical or subtropical regions. The patients had confirmed diagnosis of either P. falciparum malaria, dengue virus, influenza virus, bacterial respiratory tract infection, or culture-confirmed bacterial gastroenteritis, representing the most common disease etiologies. We used multivariate and machine learning methods to assess host-response protein profiles between the different disease groups and healthy control subjects and identified disease-specific protein signatures.
